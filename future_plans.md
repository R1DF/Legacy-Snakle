## Record of future plans
This record of ideas serves to show ideas that have either been **confirmed** (planned) or are **put to later consideration and might not be implemented** (tentative). Bugs are also tracked in the bottom of the page.

### Planned ideas
* Removal of a forced restart when font manager changes are saved, with the font selector being updated. **(v1.0.0)** - 29.04.22
* Automatic game restart after settings are changed. **(v1.0.0?)** - 29.04.22
* An ability to add custom word packs in the game. **(V1.x)** - 29.04.22

### Tentative ideas
* An ability to change the amount of milliseconds a scale's border changes when highlighted. - 29.04.22
* An ability to make a custom theme in the program (could come as its own program, hosted on the internet or saved locally). - 29.04.22
* An error handler that displays an error message when the game is unable to load. - 29.04.22

### Detected bugs
* If the last font gets deleted via the font manager, the game can't start because the index value is too high. **(pre-v1.0.0)** - 29.04.22
