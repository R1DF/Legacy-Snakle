THIS GAME CURRENTLY HAS NO RELEASE YET.
# Snakle - A Pythonic version of Wordle
## About Snakle
Snakle is a simple recreation of the famous and simple video game Wordle, made by Josh Wardle, and currently owned by The New York Times Company. The downloadable and lightweight app will feature elements of the core game, but allows users to select more settings to their will.

## Planned features
* Allows users to create their own words packs to select words from, and contains a preinstalled pack as well
* Allows people to alter some settings of the game, such as the amount of tries a person can have to edit the difficulty
* Allows people to select different themes for the game that will work every time

## Credits
Wordle has been developed by Josh Wardle. It's currently owned by the New York Times Company.<br>
Snakle written entirely by me on Python with the usage of the tkinter library.

## Download
Currently, the game is unfinished, so there's no stable version yet. A full release is planned after development of the first version finishes.
To run the program by source, you will need Python 3.9.0 or higher.

## Other information
### Using code
If you wish to use any code here on your own project that gets published, please do so with given credit (i.e. in accordance with the MIT Licence).<br>
The code might lack comments and be untidy - This is temporary and is planned to be improved when the first version comes.

### Contributions, user ideas, and bugs
I also don't wish to take any PRs - It's a project I merely wanted to open-source but work on by myself. 

However, if you have **an idea** for the game, however, please check [this record](future_plans.md). If the idea you think of is not listed there, you can submit an issue in this repository and I will make sure to respond, regardless if I accept it or not.<br>
