# Legacy Snakle - A Pythonic version of Wordle
## About Legacy Snakle
_Legacy Snakle_ is a simple recreation of the famous and simple video game **Wordle**, made by **Josh Wardle**, and currently owned by the **New York Times Company**.
The downloadable and lightweight Windows app features elements of the core game, but allows users to select a few more settings to their will.<br>

Legacy Snakle lets you:
* Play with words given from any pack you download without waiting 24 hours each time (including some preinstalled ones!)
* Configure the program's theme if you're not a fan of the default blue and yellow one (There's a more Wordle themed one too!)
* Track your progress with completing a certain pack
* Create your own word packs which can fit in any piece of text that is 5 letters long!\*
* Select whether you'd like for sound to be played<br>

\* If you don't want to create .JSON packs on your own, you might want to check [this](https://github.com/R1DF/Snakle-Pack-Editor) program out.<br>

## Credits
Wordle has been developed by **Josh Wardle**. It's currently owned by the **New York Times Company**.<br>
Snakle written entirely by me on **Python** with the usage of the **tkinter** library, as well as **TOML**.<br>
The Invertocat logo is owned by **GitHub** and was only used to be displayed on a button.<br>
The following people on freesound.org made the sound effects used:
* **SamsterBirdies** (letter not in word)
* **JapanYoshiTheGamer** (letter in correct place)
* **sophieciruela** (letter in word but not correct place)
* **Leszek_Szary** (button click)
* **dland** (file selector selected)<br>

## Download
Please check the Releases section of the repository. Legacy Snakle is only downloadable for Windows._<br>
To run the program by source, you will need Python 3.9.0 or higher.<br>

## Other information
### Why "Legacy" Snakle?
Legacy Snakle itself started merely as _Snakle_ on 24th February 2022. However, due to reasons that both I was and wasn't in control of, there were massive gaps between development constantly.<br><br>
Because of this, as my coding style gradually changed the code I kept writing in this project was always different in style when compared to the times before.
This made coding the program painful every time I come back as I needed to catch up on how the program already worked. Also, Snakle (and Legacy Snakle, now) used merely the tkinter library with Python.
While it's possible to make games with tkinter, it's not the best choice for further or slightly more complicated projects. Snakle turned out to be one of them for me. Coding updates and such would have been challenging later on.
A third reason is that I kept re-coding classes that I reused a lot in other projects, mainly the `canvas_ui` widgets that I hoped later on late-development to make a separate module and reuse it.
Keeping code DRY is always better than keeping it WET, after all.<br><br>
On 2nd November 2022, I had a question of completely abandoning this project, however I chose to complete its first version instead but never give it further updates, keeping it in its "Legacy" form. This made the project complete without forcing me to bear the burden of maintaining it later on. I managed to complete the entire project on 5th November, 3 days later. I'd say it's in time for Guy Fawkes Night, but I'm not British.<br><br>
Maybe I'll retry making Snakle one day. But if I do, it will certainly be coded more differently than how this Legacy Snakle was.

### Using code
If you wish to use any code here on your own project that, please do so with given credit (i.e. in accordance with the MIT Licence). I don't think you will want to use any code here, though.<br>

### Contributions, user ideas, and bugs
As written previously, I do not wish to work on this project anymore. The only chance I'll ever update this is if I discover a small bug that I can fix (which is worth fixing, too). I am not going to accept any user ideas nor do I plan to accept contributions - This project is final.
