# Snakle - A Pythonic version of Wordle
## About Snakle
Snakle is a simple recreation of the famous and simple video game Wordle, made by Josh Wardle, and currently owned by The New York Times Company. This downloadable and lightweight app features elements of the core game, but allows users to select more settings to their will.

## Features
* Allows users to create their own words packs to select words from, and contains a preinstalled pack as well
* Allows people to alter some settings of the game, such as the amount of tries a person can have to edit the difficulty
* Allows people to select different themes for the game that will work every time

## Credits

Snakle written entirely by me on Python with the usage of the tkinter library.

## Download
Currently, the game is unfinished, so there's no stable version yet.
To run the program by source, you will need Python 3.9.0 or higher.

## Extra
If you wish to use any code here on your own project that gets published, please do so with given credit (i.e. in accordance with the MIT Licence).<br>
The code might lack comments and be untidy - This is temporary and is planned to be fixed when the first version comes.
